In our group, we have chosen to make a program to specifically check phone numbers from scammers. Dividing it into a **user** and **admin** section. Users can enter suspicious phone numbers and the system will analyze them against the admin database to see what percentage chance they are scammers. In addition, there is a special feature called **Elastic Search** that can be applied and increase the efficiency of searching for phone numbers quickly and accurately.
